# MS93 Earthboung Frog Theme <br> 

`unfinished`

MS93 was a platform i found surfing through the internet, once i found out how customizable it was i got invested in making themes. i learned how to write btter css and learned more techniques along the way. this is the last theme i worked on before the website abruptly and indefinitely shut down due to *industrial espionage* âœ¨ and security leaks.
